# This caller workflow tests, builds, and pushes the image to Docker Hub.
# It also tests that a Singularity container can be run from the Docker image.
# Instructions: replace all the <placeholder> stubs in this template with values for your image.

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

    with:
      path_to_context: "./<program name>/<program version>"  # Path to directory with Dockerfile and context, e.g. "./spades/3.12.0"; if you need to have the whole repo as context (e.g. to use files in test_data), use "."
      dockerfile_name: "Dockerfile"  # Name of the Dockerfile, should be "Dockerfile"; if you need to have the whole repo as context, use e.g. "./spades/3.12.0/Dockerfile"
      cache: "<program name>"  # Use the program name as a nickname for a GitHub cache of your image's layers, e.g. "spades". The cache will speed up re-running the workflow.
