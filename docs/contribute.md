## Contributing
So far, we've created a bunch of docker images that we use in our day-to-day activities, but if there is a specific tool you do not see on our list and would like to add your own docker image, we would love to add it to the list.

Discover a bug or having issues with our images? Do you have a suggestion or advice for improving our docker images? [Please submit an issue under the Issues tab on our github repository](https://github.com/StaPH-B/docker-builds/issues)

### How to contribute a new Docker image
1. Build your own docker image using a Dockerfile (information on this in [Develop your own container](https://staph-b.github.io/docker-builds/make_containers/) )
2. Test to make sure it works in the way that you intend it to (e.g. give ILMN reads to a SPAdes docker container, receive SPAdes assembly out)
3. Fork this github repository using the fork button at the top right hand of the github page.
4. Add your Dockerfile (and any other required files required for building) to your forked repository following this convention:
    * The first directory should be the name of the program with special characters removed, and it's preferable to remove uppercase - `/spades`
    * The second directory should be the version number of the program, in X.X.X format - `/spades/3.12.0`
    * Lastly the Dockerfile and any other files required for building (hopefully there are none) belong in the sub-directory - `/spades/3.12.0/Dockerfile` and `/spades/3.12.0/some-other-file-needed-for-building.txt`
    * NOTE: There is a file size limit for github (I believe 100MB/file), so if you have a program with a huge database or file of some kind -  we won't be able to store the it in our github repository, and that database should be downloaded as part of the Dockerfile instructions with `wget`, `curl`, etc.
5. Please edit the `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` with the appropriate information for your program (follow alphabetical order please!) and commit changes to your forked repo. It's easiest to copy a line for an existing program from the raw markdown documents [README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StaPH-B/docker-builds/master/README.md) or [LICENSE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StaPH-B/docker-builds/master/LICENSE.md) and replace the information with your new image.
6.  Visit our docker-builds github repository and a green "Submit Pull Request" button should appear near the top of the page. Click it, and submit a pull request to merge your forked repository into our repository.
7. We will take a look at your additions/changes, do some testing, and decide on whether or not to incorporate the changes into the master branch. We will most likely accept all new docker images, but if you have a specific change to an existing image we may not accept it. These images were built with the purpose of being used for clinical lab validations, so they should stay static, especially if a particular public health lab has incorporated that image into their clinically validated workflow.
8. If we accept your pull request, we will then add your docker image to the StaPH-B docker hub repository. Once the docker-hub builds the image (successfully), it will be available and downloadable via `docker pull staphb/name-of-your-image:0.0.0` or `docker pull staphb/name-of-your-image:latest`

### How to create automated TravisCI tests for a Docker image
1. Create your own development branch, perhaps called `yourname-travis`, for pushing commits to.
    * Alternatively, you could fork the repo, and push commits to your forked repo, but you'll have to sign up for TravisCI and authorize access to your github repos.
2. Add a `docker build` command to `.travis.yml` file under the `install:` section. Follow convention of previous lines. No need to prefix the image name with `staphb` like `staphb/mash:2.1`. Just make sure this image name is the same as what is in your test that follows. 
3. Create a script, bash or python (or perl possibly?) that can run the docker container and test it in some way. To pass Travis tests, it will need to exit with a 0 exit code. This can be as simple as pulling up the help options for a program, or you could have more extensive tests. Just don't go too crazy and add tests that would take hours to run ðŸ˜„ 
4. If you push changes to your development branch (which is under the staph-b/docker-builds repo), then travis should automatically test the changes using the `.travis.yml` file. If Travis passes successfully, submit a pull request!
